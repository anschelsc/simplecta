SIMPLECTA DEBUG LOG
-------------------

10/20/13
-- "API error 5 (datastore_v3: TIMEOUT)", managed to replicate bug on my own hosted version of Simplecta
-- Quick fixed, stopped simplecta from sending too many queries to the datasource.
-- Added a counter in showall.go to limit the # of rss posts being queried.
-- Will look into alternatives and a way to contain the amount of data stored. 1GB global storage limit on free GAE accounts.
NB (ASC): I don't think the problem is the amount of data stored, because (a) this fix doesn't actually change the size of the store, and (b) this is not running on a free account. However, the problem is very likely caused by the page taking too long to load, for which limiting the number of unread items is a reasonable fix.
